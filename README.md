An app to visually compose simple pentatonic music, it's written in Typescript, it also uses Redux.

It currently allows to visually compose or to randomly generate simple music with four different instruments : violin (purple), flute (green), clarinet (yellow) and contrabassoon (red). Work in progress.

The app was created with Create React Native App, it's a managed Expo project, so it follows the usual commands - 'npm start' to run it in the development mode, 'npm eject' to eject from the managed workflow and the usual expo build commands.

Below is a screenshot, the design is currently WIP:
